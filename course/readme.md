# VIRTUAL_FPGA_LAB_WORKSHOP

## About the Workshop:
__Course: “Getting Started with FPGAs”,__
a one-hour primer to get you off the ground developing your first FPGA logic. Several low-cost FPGA boards are supported. This course uses a virtual FPGA lab within the Makerchip online IDE.

Within Makerchip, you’ll use Verilog or the latest Transaction-Level Verilog to build and simulate a counter circuit and show the count on the virtual 7-segment display. Then, if you have a supported FPGA board, such as Basys 3 or iCEBreaker (+ 7-segment display), you’ll be able to run your design on your own FPGA. From there, the sky’s the limit.

## Makerchip and TL-Verilog:
[Makerchip](https://www.makerchip.com/) is a free online environment for developing high-quality integrated circuits. You can code, compile, simulate, and debug Verilog designs, all from your browser. Your code, block diagrams, and waveforms are tightly integrated. [Makerchip](https://www.makerchip.com/) supports the emerging Transaction-Level Verilog standard. [Transaction-Level Verilog](http://tl-x.org/), or [TL-Verilog](http://tl-x.org/), represents a huge step forward, by eliminating the need for the legacy language features of Verilog and by introducing simpler syntax. At the same time, TL-Verilog adds powerful constructs for pipelines and transactions. More details about TL-Verilog: [https://www.redwoodeda.com/tl-verilog](https://www.redwoodeda.com/tl-verilog)

## Features of Virtual FPGA Lab:
- Move back and forth between cycles so that we can visualize what's happening in each and every cycle.
- Faster to see the output for simple designs. No need to wait for Synthesis, Implementation and Bitstream Generation.
