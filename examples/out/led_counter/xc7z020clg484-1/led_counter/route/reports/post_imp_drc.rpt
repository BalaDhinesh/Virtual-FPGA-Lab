2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
8 out of 18 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: led[10], led[11], led[12], led[13], led[14], led[15], led[8], led[9].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
8 out of 18 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: led[10], led[11], led[12], led[13], led[14], led[15], led[8], led[9].
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net gen_clkF_LED_PIPE_refresh_a1/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin gen_clkF_LED_PIPE_refresh_a1/LED_PIPE_Leds_a0[15]_i_2/O, cell gen_clkF_LED_PIPE_refresh_a1/LED_PIPE_Leds_a0[15]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT gen_clkF_LED_PIPE_refresh_a1/LED_PIPE_Leds_a0[15]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 16 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[0], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[10],
LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[11], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[12],
LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[13], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[14],
LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[15], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[1], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[2],
LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[3], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[4], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[5],
LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[6], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[7], LED_PIPE_Leds_a0_reg[8]
 (the first 15 of 16 listed)
Related violations: <none>

PLIO-3#1 Warning
Placement Constraints Check for IO constraints  
Partially locked IO Bus is found. Following components of the IO Bus led[15:0] are not locked:  led[15] led[14] led[13] led[12] led[11] led[10] led[9] led[8]
Related violations: <none>

ZPS7-1#1 Warning
PS7 block required  
The PS7 cell must be used in this Zynq design in order to enable correct default configuration.
Related violations: <none>
